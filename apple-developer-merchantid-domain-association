# Apple Pay Domain Association File
# This file is required for Apple Pay to work in production
# Place this file at: https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association

# Note: You need to replace this with your actual Apple Pay merchant ID
# and configure it in your Apple Developer account

# For testing purposes, you can use Stripe's test merchant ID
# In production, you'll need your own merchant ID from Apple

# This is a placeholder file - you'll need to:
# 1. Register your domain with Apple
# 2. Get your merchant ID from Apple Developer
# 3. Replace this content with the actual domain association file
